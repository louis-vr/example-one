			<h2 class="name">30th (Current) Prime Minister</h2>
			<p class="info">Scott John Morrison (born 13 May 1968) is an Australian politician serving as Prime Minister of Australia and Leader of the Liberal Party since 2018. He served as Treasurer of Australia from 2015 to 2018. Morrison was first elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Cook in 2007. Ideologically, he identifies himself as a pragmatic conservative.
				</br></br>
				Morrison was born in Sydney and studied economic geography at the University of New South Wales. He worked as Director of the New Zealand Office of Tourism and Sport from 1998 to 2000 and was Managing Director of Tourism Australia from 2004 to 2006. Morrison was also State Director of the New South Wales Liberal Party from 2000 to 2004.
				</br></br>
				After his election to Parliament in 2007, Morrison was appointed to the opposition frontbench after the 2010 election. Following the Coalition's victory at the 2013 election, Morrison was appointed Minister for Immigration and Border Protection in the Abbott Government. In that capacity he was responsible for implementing Operation Sovereign Borders. In a 2014 cabinet reshuffle, Morrison was made Minister for Social Services. He was promoted to the role of Treasurer of Australia in September 2015, when Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister.
				</br></br>
				In August 2018, Peter Dutton challenged Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Turnbull defeated Dutton, but tensions continued to mount and the party voted in favour of holding a second ballot; Turnbull chose not to be a candidate. In that second vote on 24 August, Morrison emerged as a compromise candidate, defeating Dutton and Julie Bishop to become Leader of the Liberal Party. He was sworn in as Prime Minister later that day. Morrison went on to lead the Coalition to an upset victory in the 2019 federal election.
